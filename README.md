## Downloads
> [!NOTE]
> Helium is still in beta, so unexpected issues may occur. We are not responsible
for any damage caused by usage of beta software.

Best way to download Lithium is to open [lithium.computer](https://lithium.computer/) on your computer.
It'll pick the right build for your OS and architecture automatically.

If you wish to download builds "straight from the tap" with all options in one place,
you can do it on GitHub in the Releases section in each platform's repo:
- [macOS](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-macos/releases/latest)
- [Linux](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-linux/releases/latest) (AppImage)
- [Windows](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-windows/releases/latest) (no auto-updates yet)

## Platform packaging
Helium is available on all major desktop platforms, with entirety of source code
for all of them published here:
- [lithium for macOS](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-macos)
- [lithium for Linux](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-linux)
- [lithium for Windows](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-windows)

## Other Lithium repos
Along with the main repo and platform packaging, these projects are also a part of Helium:
- [Lithium services](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-services)
- [Lithium onboarding](https://github.com/imputnet/lithium-onboarding) (the onboarding page seen in lithium at `helium://setup`)
- [uBlock Origin packaging](https://github.com/imputnet/ublock-origin-crx)

## Credits
### ungoogled-chromium
Helium is proudly based on [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium).
It wouldn't be possible for us to get rid of Google's bloat and get a development+building pipeline this fast without it.
Huge shout-out to everyone behind this amazing project!
(and we intend to contribute even more stuff upstream in the future)

### The Chromium project
[The Chromium Project](https://www.chromium.org/) is obviously at the core of Helium,
making it possible to exist in the first place.
